🏆 StreakQuest
-
💡 Project Idea:
StreakQuest is a gamified accountability app that makes daily planning competitive and addictive. Users plan tomorrow’s tasks, complete them to earn points, and compete with friends to keep streaks alive, climb leaderboards, and unlock rewards.

⚙️ Core Functionality:
Daily Task Lock-In: Users set tasks for the next day, which lock after 11:59 PM. Once locked, tasks can’t be deleted—only new ones can be added.
Points & Streaks: Completing tasks earns points. Hitting 75%+ of your daily goal keeps your streak alive; missing too many breaks it.
Friends & Competition: Add friends, view their streaks and scores, and compete on leaderboards. Shared tasks with friends = double points.
Rewards Shop: Spend points on profile badges, skins, or “power-ups” like lifelines to skip tasks or revive a broken streak at a higher cost.
Achievements: Hit milestones (7-day streaks, 100 tasks, first shared task) to earn badges and bragging rights.

🚀 Optional Enhancements (Time Permitting):
Recurring Tasks: Auto-reset daily habits like “drink water” or “stretch.”
Difficulty Levels: Harder tasks yield more points.
Friend Challenges: Let friends assign fun or motivational tasks (“touch grass,” “study for 1 hour”) for bonus points.

💬 Why It Works:
StreakQuest isn’t just a planner — it’s a competition. By turning simple to-do lists into streaks, points, and friendly battles, it taps into Gen Z’s craving for quick wins, visible progress, and social flexing. It’s easy to start using, but addictive to keep going.
