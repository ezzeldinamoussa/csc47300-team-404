    <hr> <h3>Core Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily Task Lock-In:</strong> Users set tomorrow’s tasks, which lock after 11:59 PM (no deleting, only adding).</li>
      <li><strong>Points & Streaks:</strong> Each completed task earns points. Hitting 75%+ keeps your streak alive, while missing too many breaks it.</li>
      <li><strong>Friends & Competition:</strong> Add friends, see their streaks and points, and battle on leaderboards. Shared tasks with friends = double points.</li>
      <li><strong>Rewards Shop:</strong> Spend points on profile badges, skins, or “power-ups” like lifelines to skip tasks or revive broken streaks at higher cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Milestones (7-day streak, 100 tasks completed, first shared task) earn badges and bragging rights.</li>
    </ul>
