  <h1>Project Idea: StreakQuest</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    StreakQuest is a gamified accountability app built to make daily planning competitive and addictive. 
    Users set tasks for the next day, complete them to earn points, and compete with friends to keep streaks alive, 
    climb leaderboards, and unlock rewards.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Functionality</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Task Lock-In:</strong> Users set tomorrow’s tasks, which lock after 11:59 PM (no deleting, only adding).</li>
    <li><strong>Points & Streaks:</strong> Each completed task earns points. Hitting 75%+ keeps your streak alive, while missing too many breaks it.</li>
    <li><strong>Friends & Competition:</strong> Add friends, see their streaks and points, and battle on leaderboards. Shared tasks with friends = double points.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewards Shop:</strong> Spend points on profile badges, skins, or “power-ups” like lifelines to skip tasks or revive broken streaks at higher cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Milestones (7-day streak, 100 tasks completed, first shared task) earn badges and bragging rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optional Enhancements (if time allows)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recurring Tasks: Daily habits like “drink water” or “stretch” automatically reset each day.</li>
    <li>Difficulty Levels: Harder tasks = more points.</li>
    <li>Friend Challenges: Let friends assign silly or motivational tasks for bonus points.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Works</h2>
  <p>
    This isn’t just a planner — it’s a competition. By turning boring to-do lists into streaks, points, and friend battles, 
    StreakQuest hits Gen Z’s need for quick rewards, visible achievements, and social flexing. 
    It’s simple to start with but addictive to keep using.
